# CVweb

A Web App that uses the ChessVision project.

## Running

If you have the [ChessVision](https://github.com/gudbrandtandberg/ChessVision) package installed, make sure have `python cv_endpoint.py` running in a seperate terminal window and run 

```python main.py```

to start the webserver on `localhost:5000`.

If you do not have ChessVision installed, set the line `local = False` in `main.py` and start the server. __Note:__ this will only work when the official ChessVision server is running.
